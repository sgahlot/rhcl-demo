This readme provides instructions to install and configure *RHCL* ({url-rhcl-overview}[_Red Hat Connectivity Link_]) as
well as Red Hat build of Apache Camel in a repeatable manner. Once everything is configured, we will use this setup to
showcase RHCL integration with Camel and SSO.

== Prerequisites
RHCL depends on the following prerequisites:

. OpenShift cluster running on AWS
. `oc` command line tool is installed
. Logged in to OpenShift using the `oc` client
. Access to a DNS domain (called a hosted zone in AWS Route53):
.. This domain should be different from the domain used for the OpenShift cluster
.. Should be a subdomain under the top domain
... e.g. If `api.<TOP_DOMAIN>` is used for cluster API server and `*.apps.<TOP_DOMAIN>` is used for applications running in OCP then created
    a `rhcl.<TOP_DOMAIN>` for RHCL
.. Top domain hosted zone should have NS records for the RHCL hosted zone
. The IAM user should have at least the follow permissions:
[source,json]

----
. Red Hat SSO with the following resources set up:
.. Realm
.. OIDC client with following setup:
... Client Protocol set to `openid-connect`
... Access Type set to `confidential`
... Service Account Enabled set to `ON`
. `Java`
.. _This is NOT a RHCL prerequisite but since we will be using Red Hat build of Apache Camel,
Java is needed to build the jar file from Camel sources, for deploying in OpenShift_
. Clone this repository on your system
.. _Create an environment variable named `RHCL_DEMO_HOME` to point to the cloned directory._

[NOTE]
====
. _Follow the {url-rhcl-getting-started-pre-req}[Getting Started] article for more details on the `DNS domain` prerequisite._
.. _More information regarding `Creating a subdomain` can be found in {url-create-subdomain}[this article]._
. _The RHCL install and uninstall scripts makes use of `envsubst` command that is available on Mac and Linux._
====



== Setup environment variables

In a terminal run the following commands:

[source,bash,options="nowrap"]
----
cd $RHCL_DEMO_HOME      # <.>
cp env.template .env    # <.>
# update ".env" file with the correct values for all the variables

. ./.env                # <.>
----
<.> Change into the directory that contains the cloned repository code
<.> Copy the contents of `env.template` into `.env` file.
.. *_Update `.env` with the correct values for all the variables before running the next step_*
<.> Sets environment variables, from `.env` file, in the current environment


[NOTE]
====
The following environment variables need to be setup for installation and setup of RHCL:

. `HOSTED_ZONE_ID`
.. This is the ID of the Hosted Zone for the AWS for the rhcl domain
. `ROOT_DOMAIN_ID`
.. The FQDN for the rhcl domain - Remember that should be a different than the one used by OCP
. `GATEWAY_NS`
.. Default value set to _api-gateway_. This can be left as is
. `GATEWAY_NAME`
.. Default value set to _external_. This can be left as is
. `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
.. Base64 encoded AWS access key id value
. `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
.. Base64 encoded AWS secret access key value
. `AWS_REGION`
.. Default value set to _us-east-2_. Change it based on your environment
. `CLUSTER_ISSUER_NAME`
.. Default value set to _lets-encrypt_. This can be left as is
. `EMAIL`
.. Set to your email address
. `CAMEL_NS`
.. Default value set to _camel-test_. This can be left as is
. `CAMEL_ROUTE_NAME`
.. Default value set to _camel-route_. This can be left as is
. `OPENID_HOST`
.. Keycloak Host - used as part of SSO to retrieve JWT as well as for verification of the JWT by RHCL
. `OPENID_REALM`
.. Keycloak Realm name - used as part of SSO retrieve JWT as well as for verification of the JWT by RHCL
. `OPENID_CLIENT`
.. Client name in Keycloak realm - used as part of SSO retrieve JWT as well as for verification of the JWT by RHCL
. `OPENID_CLIENT_SECRET`
.. Client secret - used as part of SSO retrieve JWT as well as for verification of the JWT by RHCL
. `KUBECONFIG`
.. Path to the kubeconfig file. This is optional and can be left as is
. `JAVA_HOME`
.. Path to the Java home directory. This is optional and can be left as is

== Install and configure

This section provides information on installation and configuration of the following components:

. Installation of Red Hat build of Apache Camel
. Deployment of a REST application using Camel
. Installation of Red Hat Connectivity Link
. Configuration of Red Hat Connectivity Link

Run the following commands in a terminal:

[source,bash,options="nowrap"]
----
cd $RHCL_DEMO_HOME
./install.sh            # <.>
----
<.> This script will perform the following actions:
.. Installs a REST application using Red Hat build of Apache Camel in OpenShift cluster
.. Installs Red Hat Connectivity Link
.. Secures the APIs and configures exposed by Red Hat Connectivity Link to route messages to Camel

[IMPORTANT]
*_Even though the script will finish in a few seconds, the application deployment will take around 10 minutes before
it is ready to process any messages_*



== Test RHCL integration with Camel and SSO

=== GET operation for status
To test the RHCL integration with Camel run the following command in a terminal:

[source,bash,options="nowrap"]
----
$RHCL_DEMO_HOME/secure_connect/test-camel-route.sh GET status
----
This script invokes a GET call to verify the connectivity status


=== GET operation for data
To test the RHCL integration with Camel run the following command in a terminal:

[source,bash,options="nowrap"]
----
$RHCL_DEMO_HOME/secure_connect/test-camel-route.sh GET data
----
This script invokes a GET call to retrieve all the Persons available in the application

[NOTE]
_To format the JSON response, pipe the result to `jq` in the above command_


=== POST operation for inserting a new Person
To insert a new record in the application run the following command in a terminal:

[source,bash,options="nowrap"]
----
$RHCL_DEMO_HOME/secure_connect/test-camel-route.sh POST <person_id> <person_name>
----
This script invokes a POST call using the provided `person_id` and `person_name` values, to add a new person record
in the Camel application by sending the JSON body to the route exposed via RHCL

[NOTE]
_When invoking the `POST` call, this script will also retrieve the JWT from OIDC provider as the JWT is used
for authentication purpose._

=== PUT operation for updating an existing Person
To update an existing record in the application run the following command in a terminal:

[source,bash,options="nowrap"]
----
$RHCL_DEMO_HOME/secure_connect/test-camel-route.sh PUT <person_id> <person_name>
----
This script invokes a PUT call that uses the provided `person_name` to update the name of the person associated
with the provided `person_id`, in the Camel application, by sending the JSON body to the route exposed via RHCL

[NOTE]
_When invoking the `PUT` call, this script will also retrieve the JWT from OIDC provider as the JWT is used
for authentication purpose._


=== Retrieve the records with GET call

Once the previous test is successful, execute the following command to retrieve all the persons from the application:

[source,bash,options="nowrap"]
----
curl -k "https://$(oc get httproute ${CAMEL_ROUTE_NAME} -n ${CAMEL_NS} -o=jsonpath='{.spec.hostnames[0]}')/api/person"
----



== Uninstall

To uninstall Red Hat Connectivity Link and Camel, run the following commands in a terminal:

[source,bash,options="nowrap"]
----
cd $RHCL_DEMO_HOME
./uninstall.sh                  # <.>
----
<.> This script performs following operations in the OpenShift cluster:
. Uninstalls RHCL config
. Uninstalls Red Hat Connectivity Link
. Uninstalls Camel
